# Powered Gaming Ecosystem Smart Contract

## Overview

This smart contract provides a robust and flexible framework for managing a blockchain-based gaming ecosystem on the Stacks blockchain. It enables game administrators to create, manage, and distribute game assets, track player performance, and distribute rewards.

## Features

### 1. Game Asset Management

- Mint unique NFT game assets with metadata
- Supports custom attributes:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Rarity
  - Power Level
- Secure asset transfers between players

### 2. Player Management

- Player registration system
- Entry fee mechanism
- Leaderboard tracking
- Score management
- Performance statistics

### 3. Reward Distribution

- Bitcoin reward distribution for top players
- Flexible reward calculation based on player performance
- Secure and transparent reward mechanism

## Contract Components

### Key Data Structures

- **Game Asset NFT**: Represents unique in-game items
- **Leaderboard**: Tracks player scores and statistics
- **Admin Whitelist**: Manages contract administrator access

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error constants for various scenarios:

- Authorization errors
- Invalid input errors
- Insufficient funds
- Transfer failures
- Leaderboard-related errors

## Main Functions

### Administration

- `add-game-admin`: Add new administrators
- `initialize-game`: Configure game parameters
  - Set entry fee
  - Define maximum leaderboard entries

### Asset Management

- `mint-game-asset`: Create new game asset NFTs
- `transfer-game-asset`: Transfer game assets between players

### Player Interactions

- `register-player`: Join the game ecosystem
- `update-player-score`: Update player performance
- `distribute-bitcoin-rewards`: Distribute rewards to top players

## Security Measures

- Role-based access control
- Input validation
- Strict authorization checks
- Secure fund transfers
- Error handling and prevention mechanisms

## Requirements

- Stacks blockchain
- Compatible Stacks wallet
- Minimum STX balance for entry fee

## Deployment Considerations

- First contract deployer is automatically the initial admin
- Careful configuration of game parameters recommended
- Integrate with external Bitcoin reward bridge for full functionality

## Usage Example

```clarity
;; Add an admin
(add-game-admin 'new-admin-principal)

;; Initialize game
(initialize-game u50 u100)  ;; 50 STX entry, 100 max leaderboard entries

;; Mint a game asset
(mint-game-asset
  "Legendary Sword"
  "A powerful mythical weapon"
  "Legendary"
  u900
)

;; Register a player
(register-player)

;; Update player score
(update-player-score 'player-principal u500)
```

## Potential Improvements

- More sophisticated reward calculation
- Enhanced leaderboard sorting
- Additional player statistics tracking
- External oracle integration for reward distribution
